    "Problem 5 was about speeding up the inference using loops implicitly present in matrix multiplication instead of explicit loops in Python. In this problem, we will explore a strategy to truly reduce the total number of computations required to find nearest neighbors without sacrificing too much accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To speed up nearest neighbor search we will employ *Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)* functions. For a given distance metric, the locality sensitive hash should put items that are similar into the same bucket. Notice that this is essentially a design choice opposite to traditional cryptographic hash functions that should amplify the difference of similar inputs (typically we want that small perturbations of data result in large changes to the hash value).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest implementations of LSH approximates the cosine distance. Let $x\\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ and $y\\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ be two vectors. Their cosine distance is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    d_\\text{cos}(x,y) = \\frac{x \\cdot y}{\\|x\\| \\|y\\|} = \\cos\\left(\\theta(x,y)\\right),\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\theta(x,y)$ is the unsigned angle between $x$ and $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will construct a family $H$ of hash functions that are an LSH for angle distances (an approximation to cosine distance). Assume $p\\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ is a random vector (components are sampled from the normal distribution) of length 1. Then define the hash function $h(x) = \\text{sgn}(x\\cdot p)$, where $\\text{sgn()}$ is the sign function. It can be proven that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    p_{h\\in H}[h(x)=h(y)] = 1 - \\frac{\\theta(x,y)}{\\pi}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation means that the probability of a hash collision grows as the the angle between two vectors gets smaller. Therefore, vectors that are close according to the cosine distance will be put with high probability into the same bin (we use the fact that for small $\\theta$ we can approximate $\\cos(\\theta) = 1 - \\theta/\\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will say that a family of randomly chosen hash functions $H$ is $(d_1, d_2, p_1, p_2)$-sensitive with respect to a distance metric $d$ if for any $x$ and $y$:\n",
    "1. If $d(x,y) \\leq d_1$ then $p_{h\\in H}[h(x)=h(y)] \\geq p_1$.\n",
    "2. If $d(x,y) \\geq d_2$ then $p_{h\\in H}[h(x)=h(y)] \\leq p_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, our family of randomly chosen hyperplanes is $(d_1, d_2, (1-d_1)/\\pi, (1-d_2)/\\pi)$-sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, vectors should be placed into the same bin with a high probability if their distance is smaller than a threshold, and with a low probability if their distance is larger that the threshold. By combining hashing functions we can get closer to this ideal sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a family of hash functions $H$ with sensitivity $(d_1, d_3, p_1, p_2)$ we can construct a new family $H'$ by combining $r$ functions from $H$:\n",
    "1. AND: let $h=[h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_r] \\in H'$ and $h(x)=h(y)$ if and only if $\\forall_i h_i(x)=h_i(y)$. Then $H'$ is $(d_1, d_2, (p_1)^r, (p_2)^r)$-sensitive.\n",
    "2. OR: let $h=[h_1, h_2, \\ldots, h_r] \\in H'$ and $h(x)=h(y)$ if and only if $\\exists_i h_i(x)=h_i(y)$. Then $H'$ is $(d_1, d_2, 1-(1-p_1)^r, 1-(1-p_2)^r)$-sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "AND makes all probabilities shrink, but properly choosing $r$ we can make the lower probability approach 0 while the higher does not. Conversely, OR makes all probabilities grow, we can make the upper probability approach 1 while the lower does not.\n",
